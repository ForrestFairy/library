# Library

My try of somewhat bigger project which is a website for library created in Elixir with Phoenix framework

# Things to add

- [x] Pagination
- [ ] A way to add books from a csv file
- [ ] Easy way to choose a specific katalog
- [ ] Add users with authentication

# How to start

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
